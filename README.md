this demo news app will explore Redux style Unidirectional Data Flow architechure pattern using [ReSwfit](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift) framework. the goal is to increase the unit testibility of the app, there might be some part of the apps that are not fully covered by unit tests due to time limit, but it should cover large portion of the app, you might also experience stuttering while scrolling on simulator, but it doesn't happen on real device.
